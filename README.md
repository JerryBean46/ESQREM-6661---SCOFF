# ESQREM-6661---SCOFF
This repository contains various R packages for analyzing dichotomous response data. 
The scoff data set has 3000+ yes/no responses to five eating disorder questions. 
The R files show examples about how dichotomous can be analyzed using both classical test methods 
and item response methods.
Download the files and put them in the same directory (folder). Open the R files in RStudio and run each per
our class discussion.
